# Funny Apps

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LIVE_DEMOs-visit-green)](https://funnyapps.directory/)

This repository contains a collection of entertaining web applications built with various technologies and with the help of AI only. The goal is to showcase creativity and provide unique, engaging web experiences for everyone.

Live demos: [Funny Apps Directory](https://funnyapps.directory/)

## Motivation

This project is a personal exploration of AI and web development, aiming to create amusing and engaging applications for all to enjoy. The goal is to see how far AI-generated code can go - and how entertaining (or broken) the results can be.

## Summary

- 99.8% AI-generated code (with minimal manual edits)
- Dozens of unique, fun web apps
- Modern tech stacks (React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
- Live demos for every project

## Development Rules

1. Max 10 minutes to write a prompt
2. Max 4 hours total to "vibe tune" the result
3. Any tech stack goes
4. Default to trusting the AI, even when it's clearly unhinged
5. Minimal manual edits (cap at ~0.2% of the codebase or 3-5 lines)
6. Deploy it live, no matter how weird it gets
7. You can use this [starter repository](https://github.com/RustyDaemon/ai-challenge-bootstrap) if you want, but it's not required

All code is generated by AI, with minimal manual edits.

## Notes

- The code is generated by AI.
- There may be occasional bugs or unexpected behavior, as the AI is not infallible.
- Code quality may vary, but the focus is on fun and creativity rather than perfection.
- There may be strange or unexpected features, as the AI sometimes goes off-script.
- No guarantees of production-readiness or stability - these are meant to be fun experiments!
- Use at your own risk.
